## 1. Raw Data

Data on dust levels throughout the museum have been collected since 2016 using a TriGlossMaster glossmeter.  The glossmeter records gloss levels at three light angles 20 degrees, 60 degrees and 85 degrees.  The readings for a clean glass microscope slide are used as the standard against which the exposed i.e. dusty slides are compared. 

## 2. % Loss of Gloss calculations

The % Loss of Gloss is a calculated value based on the comparison of the measured values for exposed slides against a clean glass slide. 

> E.g. Clean Slide: 98.0 Exposed Slide: 95.0 
85.0-98.0/98.0*100 = -13.27%
